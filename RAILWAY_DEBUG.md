# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: PORT Environment Variable

Railway is having trouble with the PORT environment variable. Let's try the simplest approach:

## Solution 1: Direct Python Execution (Current)
- Remove railway.json completely
- Use simple Procfile: `web: python backend/app.py`
- Use Dockerfile.simple with Python direct execution
- Let Railway auto-detect the setup

## Key Changes Made:
1. **Removed railway.json** - Let Railway auto-detect
2. **Simplified Procfile** - Use Python instead of gunicorn
3. **Python Direct Execution** - backend/app.py handles PORT internally
4. **Auto PORT Detection** - app.py already has: `port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))`

## Expected Behavior:
- Railway detects Dockerfile.simple
- Railway uses Procfile: `web: python backend/app.py`
- Python app.py reads PORT from environment automatically
- Should work without PORT errors

## If Still Fails:
Try setting PORT manually in Railway Variables:
```
PORT=8080
```

## Debugging Steps:
1. Check Railway auto-detection
2. Verify Procfile execution
3. Check Python app startup logs
4. Manual PORT override if needed
