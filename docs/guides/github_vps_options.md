# GitHub VPS Integration Options for Gold Trading Calculator

## ❌ GitHub Does NOT Provide VPS Services

GitHub itself doesn't offer VPS hosting, but provides:
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Development environment only
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation only
- **GitHub Pages**: Static site hosting only

None of these support MT5 or 24/7 trading applications.
